## Felipe's Sandoval Test

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- I'm new at React not going to lie and this was really fun, i have been using Angular and Angular.js most of my carrer

## Let's get down to business, this is a Letter Game

- You have to pick letters to compose the words given in the dictionary
- It validates if they exist... that's pretty much it xD

## Part 3

I'm supposed to list the more severe problems here we go

- In /* Start server */ the callback fails, you can define `user` as `let user` because you cant mutate constants, unless its a property of an object

- i believe the ```doesnt work

- Data base connection, never ever ever do this its a huge segurity breach, this belongs to the back end

- Credentials, you should never handle this on the front end, its a sin and you should only persist tokens
and data to display, if you really have to at least use enviroment (you can use enviroment for ports and URL's in general or at least a respath).
If it is back end it should go to an enviroment too

- Services should be on a service file and be implemented on components, so you can reuse those and only change the specific implementation

- i would handle the htm

- its not very important buf if you are using webpack you can define basepaths to make your paths to files shorter
